# Anythink Market

This project contains both a Python FastAPI server and a Node.js Express server for managing a task list. The endpoints have been migrated from Python to Node.js.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directories and files:

### Node.js Express Server (Primary)
- `my-express-server/src/app.js`: Main Express server implementation with all migrated endpoints
- `my-express-server/package.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `my-express-server/Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for the Express server
- `my-express-server/README.md`: Detailed Node.js server documentation

### Python FastAPI Server (Legacy)
- `python-server/src/main.py`: Original FastAPI server implementation
- `python-server/src/__init__.py`: Python package marker
- `python-server/requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `python-server/Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for the FastAPI server

### Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-container Docker configuration for running both servers

## Getting Started

### Running the Node.js Server

#### Using Docker Compose
```shell
docker compose up
```

The Node.js server will be available at http://localhost:8001

#### Running Locally
```shell
cd my-express-server
npm install
npm start
```

### Running the Python Server (Legacy)
```shell
docker compose up python-server
```

The Python server will be available at http://localhost:8000

## API Routes

Both servers provide the following API routes:

### GET `/`
Returns a "Hello World" message.

**Response:**
```
Hello World
```

### GET `/tasks`
Retrieves the complete task list.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    "Write a diary entry from the future",
    "Create a time machine from a cardboard box",
    "Plan a trip to the dinosaurs",
    "Draw a futuristic city",
    "List items to bring on a time-travel adventure"
  ]
}
```

### POST `/tasks`
Adds a new task to the task list.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "text": "Your task description here"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Task added successfully"
}
```

## Migration Details

The endpoints have been successfully migrated from Python FastAPI to Node.js Express:

- ✅ All routes maintain the same paths and functionality
- ✅ Request/response formats are identical
- ✅ Initial task data is preserved
- ✅ Both servers run on their respective ports (Node.js: 8001, Python: 8000)
- ✅ Full feature parity achieved

**Dependencies:**
- Express.js for routing
- body-parser for JSON request parsing
- nodemon for development auto-reload
